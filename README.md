### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sebin Thomas - CUSAT

### Project Description
This project creates a local platform where users can upload a files in order to get them approved by their superiors. Documents get a summary of themselves displayed as well by running them through a llm. Approved documents get a watermark added to its bottom with the name of the approver.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The problem is too specific... running behind people for permissions and approvals when organizing or creating something ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Spend a lot of time creating a platform based system that may take a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge amount of effort just to implement and to be used in terms of implementing permissions ü´†
